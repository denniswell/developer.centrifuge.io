## Centrifuge Chain Test Networks

Centrifuge has multiple testnets online that have been created to test and stabilize the interaction between Centrifugeâ€™s components, but are unaudited and experimental for now. These testnets have no economic value on-chain.

* **Amber** is our release candidate and our second testnet. It is meant for audits and testing the stability of release candidates. Think of Amber as a way to test beta releases.

* **Flint** is our first testnet that has been running since November 2019. It is meant for breaking changes and testing integration with other parts of the Centrifuge ecosystem. Think of Flint as a way to test previews and alpha releases.
