In Tinlake, the collateral generally is in form of an NFT, though any other collateral could be used with a custom adapter. For an asset to be used as collateral in Tinlake, it generally must satisfy two conditions:
1) Ownership of the asset must be transferable to the Tinlake `Shelf` which holds it in escrow until the loan is repaid
2) Appraisal: There must be a way to determine the value of the collateral with oracles or automated pricing models.
